# RF-3D-Engine-ToolSet
This the beginnings of an editing tool that I was building to go along with the RF-3D-Engine I was working on. Which you can find [here](https://github.com/RandomFeatures/RF-3D-Engine-Cpp)

Githug seems to think this was written in pascal or maybe Delphi, but it was acutally writtin in Borland C++ Builder. I don't guess it matters much, but I also don't want to be confusing.
